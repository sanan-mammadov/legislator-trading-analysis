# U.S. Legislator Trading Analysis: Portfolio Optimization

## Overview
This capstone research project investigates whether retail investors can achieve above-market returns by mimicking the stock trades of U.S. Congress members. I processed and analyzed over 46,000 insider trading records from 2020-2023.

## Tools & Methodology (Advanced Excel)
While many big data projects rely on Python/R, I intentionally executed this analysis entirely within **Advanced Excel** to demonstrate high-level business analytics, data modeling, and financial evaluation skills.
* **Data Cleaning & Organization:** Managed 46,504 raw records, standardizing transaction dates, sizes, and ticker symbols.
* **Pivot Tables & Aggregation:** Built complex Pivot Tables to aggregate returns by individual politicians (e.g., Dean Phillips, David Perdue) across 1-month, 3-month, and 12-month intervals.
* **Statistical Analysis (Data Analysis Toolpak):** Ran multiple Linear Regressions to test the hypothesis of abnormal returns against the S&P 500 baseline, extracting R-squared and P-values to verify statistical significance.
* **Financial Modeling:** Applied the Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) and Jensen’s Alpha to evaluate risk-adjusted performance. Built a synthetic "Copy Trading" portfolio that yielded ~40% abnormal returns.
